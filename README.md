# Anomaly Detection Framework

This project implements a real-time anomaly detection framework using a Z-Score approach. It simulates a data stream and visualizes anomalies detected within that stream.

## Overview

The framework consists of several components:

- **Stream Simulator**: Generates synthetic data streams with trends, seasonal patterns, and random noise.
- **Z-Score Anomaly Detector**: Detects anomalies based on the Z-Score method.
- **Data Visualizer**: Visualizes the data stream and highlights detected anomalies.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
